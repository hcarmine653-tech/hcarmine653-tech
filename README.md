## Hi there, I'm Hamish Carmine
Junior Data Analyst  Medical Scientist
I’m based in Melbourne with a background in diagnostic medical science and hands‑on experience using Python, SQL, R, and Power BI. I enjoy working with messy, real‑world datasets and translating them into practical findings that support decisions.
My experience in hospital laboratories has focused on data quality, operational problem‑solving, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams. I’m now applying that same precision to analytical projects, including exploratory analysis, reporting, and introductory predictive modelling.

🔧 Technical Skills
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, basic machine learning
- SQL: Joins, CTEs, window functions, analytical queries
- R: tidyverse, data wrangling, visualisation
- Power BI: DAX, data modelling, interactive dashboards
- Other: Statistical analysis, quality assurance

📌 What You’ll Find Here
- End‑to‑end analytics projects
- SQL case studies using realistic scenarios
- R notebooks for data cleaning, exploration, and simple models
- Power BI dashboards highlighting key metrics and trends

🎯 Current Focus
Developing industry‑ready analytical work and exploring opportunities as a junior analyst in data‑driven teams.
